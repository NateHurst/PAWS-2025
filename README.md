## Highlights
### Classical Cryptography:
- Frequency analysis
- Classical ElGamal Cryptosystem Implementation

### Exponential and Subexponential attacks on the Discrete Logarithm Problem:

- Baby-step Giant-step Implementaion
- Pollard's Rho Implementation
- Pollard's Rho for Integer Factorization Implementation
- Index Calculus Implementation

### Elliptic Curve Cryptography

- Tonelli-Shanks

### TBD

## Usage Instructions

Most implementations use SageMath functions, and so a SageMath kernel is required to run the code. You can find intstructions on how to install SageMath on the SageMath installation guide: https://doc-gitlab.sagemath.org/html/en/installation/index.html

Once you have SageMath you can either choose to configure my Jupytr notebook file to run the SageMath kernel or you can directly copy and paste my code into the SageMath terminal/.sage file, changing inputs as needed.
